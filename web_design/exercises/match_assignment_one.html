		<h1>All of the branches of Web Design</h1>
		
		<p>Web development can consist of multiple layers and the use of multiple languages, depending on how interactive you would like the webite to be. As a web developer, you are in charge of the:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Website design</li>
			<li>Website Userability</li>
			<li>Functionality of the Website</li>
			<li>Deployment of the website</li>
			<li>Copywriting</li>
			<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
		</ul>
		A web developer doesn't need to be able to do all of these things, but it does help to have knowledge of each area
		
		</p>
		
		<h2>Web Site Structure</h2>
		
		<p><em>When you create a website, you must have the correct skeleton for the webpage to run.</em> This is also called a <strong>boiler plate</strong>. The boiler plate consists of the following tags to be recognized on the website on the computer.
		<ol>
			<li>!DOCTYPE html</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This indicates that the website is HTML5</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Head</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is where we put all of the scripting and the information that runs in the background.</li>
					<li>This is where we place CSS and JavaScript external files</li>
					<li>Meta data and Keywords also go here to help with Search Engine Optimization</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Title</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is where you place the title of your webpage/website</li>
					<li>This information shows up in the browser tab</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Body</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This is the information viewable on the website. Anything that you want your audience to see, you place here</li>
					<li>This is where you place:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Text</li>
							<li>Images</li>
							<li>Videos</li>
							<li>Tables</li>
							<li>Forms</li>
